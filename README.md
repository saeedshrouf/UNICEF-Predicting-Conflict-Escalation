# UNICEF-Predicting-Conflict-Escalation
Within this project, we aim to complete a thorough analysis of the transformer, xgboost, and ffnn models responsible for the prediction of conflict escalation in countries. We will be using data provided by UNICEF as well as the Fund for Peace's Fragile States Index.
